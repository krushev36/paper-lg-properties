\begin{abstract}
We present a series of models that follow the evoluciont of the two
dominant galaxies in the Local Group: the Milky Way (MW) and M31. We
use semi-analytic techniques coupled to three N-body constrained
cosmological simulations. Each simulated volume contains a pair of halos
with environmental conditions similar to the observed for the LG. The
models are computed using the public available code Galacticus. The
main objective is to study the conditions to get the best possible
agreement in three barionic properties for the MW and M31: the stellar
mass, gaseous mass and disc-to-bulge mass ratio.  Each physical
model varies the parameters controlling the star formation efficiency
and supernovae feedback. The models are run on a general sample of
dark halos with a mass range of $7\times10^{11}\hMsun<M_{\rm
  h}<7\times 10^{12}\hMsun$. For the model that best reproduce the
global properties of galaxies in this halo mass range,  we find that
the most probable values for the baryonic properties are $M_{\star}=$,
$M_{\rm gas}=$ and $f_{D/B}=$. The three LG in the constrained
simulation have values $M_{\star}=$, $M_{\rm gas}=$ and $f_{D/B}=$.

\section{Introduction}
\label{sec:introduction}


Some of the most challenging problems of studying galaxy formation are
our distance limitation to acquire data from galaxies or even bigger
structures and the time scale of the physical processes involved, so,
the best laboratories we can find are the closest ones. The Local
Group galaxies (LG), particulary the Milky Way (MW) and M31 are the
ones from where we can get more detailed observations. Because of the
latter, ongoing and new surveys like the Sloan Digital Sky Survey
\citep{2009ApJS..182..543A}, the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope
(LSST) \citep{2009arXiv0912.0201L}, VLT Survey Telectope
\citep{2011Msngr.146....2C} are dedicating efforts in providing
crucial information to encrease our comprehension on the kinematics,
structure, formation and evolution of our galaxy. Nevertheless, our
understanding of galaxy formation would never be complete without
studying a high quantity of galaxies. Over the past two decades the
amount of observations from surveys providing extragalactic data like
the SDSS,..EXAMPLES..., has increased dramatically. Evenmore, the
amount of data will exponentially grow even faster with projects like
LAMOST \citep{2009AAS...21341614N}, LSST and SkyMapper
\citep{2007PASA...24....1K}. But, despite of the currrent and
upcomming  data, there are no analytical models able to properlly
interpret these observations and with  predictive capacity  to
accurately describe the evolution and formation of a galaxy and then
clear our comprehension of the real physical phenomena involved in
such process. 


Another challenging problem is the large number of physical phenomena
implicated in the process of galactic evolution. The large  scale and
composition of structures like galaxies, where baryonic matter can be
found in several phases implies  different physics at each scale and
phase. The nowadays standard description of hierarchical galaxy
formation was first introduced by \cite{1978MNRAS.183..341W} and has
been enhanced since then. According to it, primitive gaussian
inhomogenities are amplified by gravitational instabilities producing
small density fluctuations of dark matter that  grow until  collapses
into  haloes, then, baryonic matter is attracted inside the potencial
well of these, producing a hot gaseous halo. With time, a fraction of
gas from the hot halo is free to cool  and condese forming a central
disc. Inhomogenities in the central disc allow to form smaller objects
with higher density like stars. The process of star formation is
regulated by severalphenomena like stellar stellar, supernovae and AGN
feedbacks.   


The complex behaviour of the physical phenomena shown by galaxies has
stated the necessity to tackle the problem of galaxy formation from
different angles. Up to date, two methods have been consolidated as
the cornerstones of galaxy formation: Numerical and semi-analytical
simulations.  The former are the most commonly used. This method can
be implemented at several levels of approximation to reality:  doing
dissipationless N-body simulations neglecting gas dynamics; another
approach is done by including a dissipational component, where,
different physical processes are taken into account under certain
approximations and the ones of highest complexity are the
multi-physics hydrodynamical simulations where phenomena like, cooling
flows, star formation, feedbacks or even more complex processes can be
included in a high realistic manner. 

Over the past years, codes like Gadget \citep{2005MNRAS.364.1105S},
RAMSES \citep{2002A&A...385..337T} and AREPO
\citep{2010MNRAS.401..791S} have proven to be valuable tools,
increasing the credibility of  the method. Some well known
cosmological simulations are the Millenium
\citep{2005Natur.435..629S}, Bolshoi \citep{2011ApJ...740..102K},
Aquarius \citep{2008MNRAS.391.1685S} and CLUES
\citep{2010arXiv1005.2687G}. In this paper we make use of the dark
matter merger trees catalogue provided by the CLUES simulations, this
are characterized for been constrained to  accurately recreate the
local Universse. Despite of the great successfull of this method, the
large amount of computational resources that these requires, limitats
its usage to the  available technological infrastructure, thus,
restricting the number of simulations of any research to a few
ones. This disadvantage, hinders the study of large quantities models,
which is necessary to provide a deep understanding in the evolution of
galaxies . 


On the other side are the semi-analytical simulations, which where
first proposed by \cite{1991ApJ...379...52W} based on the ideas of
hierarchical evolution. These models combine the description of  the
evolution of dark matter haloes from a cosmological background via
dark matter halo merger trees provided either from large cosmological
N-body simulations or by the Press-Schechter formalism
\citep{1974ApJ...187..425P} with a phenomenological description of any
astrophysical process. Using as input the information contained in the
merger histories, these models can follow the evolution of the
baryonic matter starting at high redshift to any stage. Considering
the formation of a hot haloe, a cooling process and the condesation of
cold gas into a central disc through apparently simple recipes, any of
the componing phases of a galaxy (hot halo, cold disc, stars and
ejecta) can be estimated. To regulate the star formation it is
tipically introduced stellar and supernovae feedback, and more
recently for high mass galaxies, AGN feedback was added to reproduce
the luminosity function at the bright end \citep{2006MNRAS.365...11C}.
Central bulges and bars are generated by the occurrence of mergers
between  central and satellites galaxies. There is a large amount of
physical phenomena that can be included in these models.  In general
all the astrophysical processes included in any semi-analytical model
are dependent  on a number of free parameters that are usually
contrained from observations.  

The greatest advantage of semi-analytitical models is its
computational versatility. These simulations are very fast and low
cost, thus, can be implemented as many times as necessary. Besides,
currently have  great successfull in reproducing global properties of
galaxies. Over the last years, the interest of these simulations has
increased. Some renamed codes are  Galacticus
\citep{2010arXiv1008.1786B}, GALFORM \citep{2010MNRAS.405.1573B} and
ChemTree \citep{2006ApJ...641....1T} among others. Notwithstanding the
capabilities of the semi-analitycal simulations, these are intended to
statistically reproduce the properties of the galaxies ,and then, are
in general limited  to only estimate external properties and
morphology of them i.e like the radius and mass of the componing
phases of the bulge or disc. 


We use the code
Galacticus\footnote{\url{https://sites.google.com/site/galacticusmodel/about}}
to study from a semi-analitycal view the problem of galaxy formation
in the neighboring Universe.  A key feature of our research is the
usage of merger trees provided by CLUES. Maybe the most important
aspect of these, are their hability to produce a set of dark matter
halos that mimics the characteristics of the Local Group , thus,
recreating the hosting haloes the MW, M31 and M33, wich we call the
'LG candidates'. Exploding the advantages of contrained simulations,
we aim investigate the space parameter of the set of physical
processes that drives the formation and morphology of  galaxies in the
Local Universe, how does these  affect the statistical properties of
this population and  whether they modify the abundace of MW and
M31-like galaxies or not. We also give special attention to the MW and
M31 candidates and study the similarities of the mock galaxies to the
observed ones. 


This paper is organized as follows. In section \ref{sec:numerical} we
present the information regarding the data we use as input and the
main features of the theoretical models implemented in the
semi-analitycal code. In section \ref{sec:discussion} is summarized
the current observational data of the Local Group we use to compare
our results. In section \ref{sec:method} is described how we proceed
to reach our goals. In section \ref{sec:results} we present the
results and discuss about them. Finally, in section
\ref{sec:conclusions} we summarize our results and present the
conclusions of this work.
  

\section{Numerical Methods}
\label{sec:numerical}

\subsection{Contrained N-body simulations and Merger Trees}
\label{sec:simulations}

In this section we briefly describe the details of the
CLUES\footnote{Constrained Local UniversE Simulations}
project\footnote{\url{http://www.clues-project.org/}} relevant to our
research, the procedure of constraining cosmological simulations and
construction of merger trees.  We have selected the three available
realizations for the WMAP5 cosmology of CLUES, which is aimed to
provide constrained cosmological simulations recreating the Local
Universe. Each of these simulations includes $1024^3$ particles with a
mass of $m_{p}=1.89\times 10^{7}$\hMsun inside a box of length
$64$\hMpc  that provides an amount of more than $5\times 10^4$ dark
matter merger trees. The cosmological parameters are consistent with
the WMAP5 cosmology in  \cite{2009ApJS..180..330K} with a density
$\Omega_{m}=0.279$, a cosmological constant $\Omega_{\Lambda} =
0.721$, a dimensionless Hubble parameter $h=0.70$, a spectral index of
primordial density perturbations $n=0.96$, a normalization
$\sigma_{8}=0.817$.  

The code used to perform the simulations is the Tree-PM MPI N-body
code Gadget2 \citep{2005MNRAS.364.1105S}. We selected  the set of
merger trees whose dark matter halos at $z=0$ are in the mass range
$11.0<\log_{10} M_{vir}/M_{\odot}<13.0$ and made  emphasis in the
subrange  $11.5<\log_{10} M_{vir}/M_{\odot}<12.5$ to study MW and
M31-type galaxies.  As mentioned above, we will give special attention
to those ''candidates'' halos  supposed to host a MW  and M31. The
amount of halos in our selected mass range  is above $9000$/box, thus,
accounting for a total of almost $30000$ merger trees when the three
boxes are included. 

% \citep{2011arXiv1107.0017F}

The standard procedure of building by means of simulations a Local
Universe able to recreate the main features of the observed, is to
constrain the initial conditions to observations. To prepare the
initial conditions of CLUES, it was used the algorithm of
\cite{1991ApJ...380L...5H}   to constrain the Gaussian random
fields. Due to its very small changes in time, the velocity field
plays a crucial roll in constraining the initial conditions. To set up
the velocity constrains, the MARK   III \citep{1997ApJS..109..333W},
SBF \citep{2001ApJ...546..681T} and the Karachentsev
\citep{2004AJ....127.2031K} catalogs were used
\citep{2011arXiv1107.0017F}, for more details of the constraining
procedure go to \cite{2010arXiv1005.2687G}. As the constrains can only
affect the large and meso scales, it was necessary to  perform a large
amount of low resolution simulations. Only three of all the
simulations had success in recreating under a certain accuracy the
properties of the dark matter distribution. 


 To tackle the problem of halo identification, it was used a FOF
 (Friends-of-Friends) algorithm through 80 snapshots corresponding to
 an interval of about 13Grys between $0<z<7$,  where was not resolved
 substructures. It was used a linking length of $b=0.17$ times the
 mean inter particle separation and the minimum resolved halo masses
 are of  $M_{\text{min}}=3.78\times 10^8 \hMsun$. The procedure used
 to build the merger trees is the standard. Starting from the snapshot
 at $z=0$, the particles bind to a particular  halo of the catalogue
 are scanned in the first snapshot $z>0$  and if there it is found any
 halo with more than thirteen particles then then this halo is called
 to be a progenitor  of the former. The process is repeated over the
 whole catalogue at $z=0$ and continued until the highest $z$. For
 more details about the halo identification and merger tree
 construction go to \cite{2011arXiv1107.0017F}. 
 

 To perform our simulations, each galaxy was modelled isolatedly and
 it was only used the information relating the masses of the
 satellites and central dark matter halos to its progenitorsover
 through all the different snapshots. 




\subsection{Semi-analytical Approach}
\label{sec:sams}
We use the semi-analytic code of galaxy formation Galacticus
\citep{2010arXiv1008.1786B}, designed to  by means of the hierarchical
merging history of  dark matter haloes, estimate the properties of the
galaxies hosted in it at any instant of its evolution.   

The code can include any model of physical process, starting from the
generation of random dark matter density distributions to calculate
stellar population properties while implementing accretion of gas,
cooling, stellar and supernovae feedback. Depending of the needs, it
is capable of generate its own Monte Carlo merger trees or just read
merger trees provided by cosmological simulations as we did,  taking
advantage of the CLUES  data. This section is dedicated to explain how
Galacticus implements the key astrophysical processes regarding our
research. 


\textbf{Mass Accretion}. 
Two modes of mass accretion are tipically considered, rapid increase
during violent mergers and  smooth accretion of matter from the
interstellar medium. In our theoretical model, is assumed that the
amount of baryonic matter gained during the accretion of dark matter
in any of the modes  is directly related by the universal baryonic
fraction $\Omega_b/\Omega_M$. The change of baryonic mass
$\dot{M}_{\text{brn}}$ is defined as: 

\begin{equation}
 \dot{M}_{\text{brn}}=
\begin{cases}
 (\Omega_b/\Omega_M)\dot{M}_{\text{halo}},\quad \text{if} \quad V_{\text{vir}}>V_{\text{rnz}}\\
\qquad \qquad \qquad \qquad \text{or} \quad z<z_{\text{rnz}}\\
0, \text{otherwise}
\end{cases},
\end{equation}

where the effects of reionization are taken into account by  imposing
the condition that no gas can be accreted at  redshifts $z$ higher
than the one of  reionization $z_{\text{rnz}}$ or if the magnitude of
the virial velocity $V_{\text{vir}}$ is less than that of reionization
$V_{\text{rnz}}$.  In case of a merger, when the satellite-to-central
mass ratio $M_{\text{stl}}/M_{\text{ctl}}$ is above the merger
fraction $F_{\text{mgr}}$, thus, a major merger, then the whole mass
of the satellite $M_{\text{stl}}$ and central $M_{\text{ctl}}$ goes to
the bulge component of the central galaxy.If a minor merger occurs
($M_{\text{stl}}/M_{\text{ctl}}<F_{\text{mgr}}$) the mass of the dic
of the central galaxy is not redirected, the stellar component of the
satellite goes to the bulge of the central but the gas mass
$M_{\text{stl-gas}}$ content  of the satellite can go to either to the
disc or the bulge, we can configure this situation by setting free
parameter $\vec{M}_{stl-gas}$ either to disc or bulge, telling to the
code what situation must occur. 

\textbf{Cooling}. Once the halo has collapsed and the hot gas halo
formed, a fraction of the gas tend cools, this redices the presure and
causes the formation of a central disc through the accretion of
gas. The rate at which the gas is cooled according to
\cite{1991ApJ...379...52W} is given by 

\begin{equation}
 \dot{M}_{cool}=4\pi r^2_{\text{cool}} \rho (r_{\text{cool}}) \dot{r}_{\text{cool}}
\end{equation}

where  $\rho(r)$ is the density profile of the hot halo and the
cooling raduis $r_{\text{cool}}$ is calculted by seeking the radius at
which the  time available for cooling equals the cooling time
$t_{\text{cool}}$.  




The cooled gas can be  transformed into stars depending on the density
of the gas during a characteristic formation timescale
$\tau_{\star}$. This depends on the rotational velocity
$V_{\text{rot}}$ of the disc according to the dynamical time
$\tau_{\text{dyn}}=R_{\text{vir}}/V_{\text{rot}}$, where
$R_{\text{vir}}$ is the characteristic radius. It is also related to
the star formation efficiency $\epsilon_{\star}$, which is assumed
fixed. We use the expression of star formation time scale

\begin{equation}
 \tau_{\star} = \epsilon^{-1}_{\star}\tau_{\text{dyn}}\left( \frac{V}{200\text{km/s}}\right)^{\alpha_\star},
\end{equation}

which is similar to that of \cite{2005MNRAS.356.1191B}, where
$\epsilon_{\star}$ and $\alpha_\star$ are free parameters. Finally,
the star formation rate of the forming stars is defined as
$\phi=M_{\text{gas}}/\tau_{\star}$, where $M_{\text{gas}}$ is the gas
mass. 

\textbf{Stellar Mass}. At early stages of star formation the gas
accreted  is basiclly Hydrogen. The internal processes of stars
produce heavier elements and when stars ends live in the form of a
supernovae these elements are expulsed to the environment enriching
the medium. The process of accretion continues and as stars form, the
abundace of combustible material changes. We used the simplest method
to model the change of stellar mass. We relate the star formation rate
$\phi$  to the stellar mass rate $\dot{M}_{\star}$ by  means of a
constant rate of decrease of fuel mass as 

\begin{equation}
 \dot{M}_{\star}=(1-R)\phi,
\end{equation}
where $R$ is the instantaneous recycled fraction. The rate of the
metal content of the fuel changes as the star formation rate, the
yield $p$ and $R$  according  to

\begin{equation}  
 \dot{M}_{\text{fuel},Z}=-(1-R)Z_{\text{fuel}}\phi+p\phi,
\end{equation}
while the rate of change the metal content of the stars
$\dot{M}_{\star, Z}$ follows from the fuel metallicity
$Z_{\text{fuel}}$. 


\textbf{Supernovae Feedback}. 

The process of star formation is regulated by several phenomena. One
of these is the stellar feedback, where, energy expulsed by the
created stars heat the surroundings preventing a fraction of gas from
cooling and forming stars (REFERENCE). When stars explode as
supernovae the energy released reheats the cooled gas and decreasing
the production of stars. This feedback of supernovae has proven to be
the dominant process that modules star formation in low and medium
mass galaxies (REFERENCE). 

We model this process through a power law relation and  assume it to
be  proportional to the rate of energy pumped in to the gas by the
stellar populations. The rate of change of the mass ejected  by
supernovae is given by 

\begin{equation}
 \dot{M}_{\text{outflow}}=\left( \frac{V_{\text{outflow}}}{V} \right)^{\alpha_{\text{outflow}}}\frac{\dot{E}}{E_{\text{canonical}}}, \label{eq:supernovae}
\end{equation}

where  $V_{\text{outflow}}$ is the velocity of the ejected outflow
mass due to supernovae, $V$ is the characteristic velocity,  $\dot{E}$
is the rate of change of the energy transmitted to the gas by stars
and $E_{\text{canonical}}$ is the total energy transmitted by a
stellar population normalized to $1M_{\odot}$. 
 

In contrast, for high mass galaxies the driving process of star
formation is the feedback produced by Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN)
\citep{2006MNRAS.365...11C}. Two growing modes are tipically assumed
for black holes: A rapid growing occurs during galaxy mergers, where,
back holes join to produce supermassive ones; This is called the
''quasar mode''. The other mode of growing is motivated by the
accretion of gas, the ''radio mode''. When the gas is attracted by the
black hole, it is mechanically heated. This feedback injects low enery
into the surroundings that is capable to decrease the gas cooling or
even stop it \citep{2006MNRAS.365...11C}. In this paper we focus on
haloes of mass lower than $1\times 10^{12}M_{\odot}$ and then it is
not necessary to include AGN feedback to our procedures. 


\section{Observational prorperties of MW and M31}  
\label{sec:discussion}  

In this section we present the values for the parameters we have
chosen to define the MW and M31: disk stellar mass, disk gaseous mass
and bulge stellar mass. 

{\bf Disk stellar mass}. The principal approach to estimate the
stellar mass in the disk of our galaxy is dynamical modelling. The
work of \cite{Klypin2002} uses a parametric model that does not
distinguish between the cold (gas) component and the stars, their
results for galaxy models that allow for exchange of angular momentum
locate the total baryonic mass of the disk between $5-6\times
10^{10}$\Msun for the MW and $7-9\times 10$\Msun for M31. Later
\cite{Widrow2005} use N-body realizations of self-consisten,
equilibrium distributions of the dark matter and stellar compoents to
address the same problem. Their models fit with good match to the
observational data have stellar masses of $3.3-4.5\times 10^{10}$\Msun
for the Milky Way and $7-10\times 10^{10}$ for
andromeda. \citep{Geehan2006} modeled the Andromeda strem using
analytic bulge-disc-halo for M31, finding the best agreement for a
disk mass of $8.4\times 10^{10}$\Msun. In this work we take
$3.3-4.5\times 10^{10}$\Msun for the Milky Way and $7-10\times
10^{10}$ for M31.   

{\bf Bulge stellar mass}. \cite{Klypin2002} constrain the MW bulge
stellar masss $1-1.2\times 10^{10}$ \Msun while for M31 $1.9-2.4\times
10^{10}$, for the same galaxy \citep{Geehan2006} find a bulge mass of
$3.3\times 10^{10}$\Msun. The MW analytical model of model
\citep{Dehnen1998} finds a range of different values with average
$\sim 0.5 10^{10}$\Msun. In this work we pick $0.5-1.2 \times
10^{10}$\Msun for the MW and $1.9-3.3\times 10^{10}$\Msun for M31. 

{\bf Disk Gaseous mass}. The abundance of gas in the Milky Way has
been constrained through chemical evolution models. The set of
observational constraints on these models most notably include the gas
and star formation rate (SFR) profiles. The relevant observational
data was compiled in \citep{Boissier99} using from the original work
in \cite{Kulkarni87,Dame93}, with a values of $6.0-8.0 \times
10^{9}$\Msun, an update implementation of this chemical evolution
model by \citep{Yin09} uses the same observations. In the case of M31
the best observational constraints come from the observations by
\citep{Cram80} with the integrated mass of neutral gas corrected by
\citep{Dame93}, yielding a value of $5.2\times 10^{9}$\Msun, there is
a systematic observational uncertainty of $5\%$ originally quoted in
\citep{Cram80}, but due to oppacity effects of the HI \citep{Braun92}  the total value of gas can increase by a $19\%$. Therefore we keep a value of $5.0-6.0\times 10^{9}$ for the mass of gas in the M31 disk and $6.0-8.0\times 10^{9}$\Msun for the Milky Way.

  in  halos of mass range of $11.0<log_{10}
  M_{\text{DM}}<13.0$.\label{tab:runs}}  
\end{table*}

To achieve our goals we have used the semi-analytic code Galacticus
v0.0.1 to perform semi-analytical simulations of different models to
study the $z=0$  properties of the simulated galaxies.  In this part
of the research we study  how sensitive are the properties of the
simulated  galaxies  to the variations of several parameters we
pretent to study. To do this, we have simulated a set of models with
parameters as shown Table \ref{tab:runs}. We have fixed cosmologycal
parameters to the WMAP5 values to be in agreement with the input data,
any other not mentioned parameters are settled to the code's default
values (To see the parameters in detail and their values go to
\cite{2010arXiv1008.1786B}). From the  simulated models of Table
\ref{tab:runs} we have defined three benchmarks,  the first is R1
which is performed with a spin parameter distribution according to the
one in \cite{2007MNRAS.376..215B}. 

For he two other simulated models R2 and R3,  we have settled the
distribution of the spin parameter to a Lognormal distribution  with a
mean  $\mu_{\lambda}=0.03687$ and dispersion $\sigma_{\lambda}=0.2216$
according to the work of \cite{2011MNRAS.411..584M} but in  R2 the gas
of satellites after a minor merger goes to the bulge of the central
galaxy and in the R3 the gas goes to the disk of the central
galaxy. All the remaining models are fixed to a Lognormal distribution
with a mean $\mu_{\lambda}=0.03687$ and dispersion
$\sigma_{\lambda}=0.2216$ as well. 
 
We have developed a set of four experiments intended to study how are
affected the stellar-to-dark matter ratio, gas-to-total mass ratio and
bulge-to-total mass ratio through the variation of the activity of
supernovae feedback with the  $\alpha_{\text{outflow}}$ parameter,
star formation in the discs with  $\epsilon_\star$ parameter, and, the
gas accretion  when $M_{\text{satel.,gas}}$ goes to the disc after a
minor merger while modifying the value of  $F_{\text{mgr}}$.As
discribed in Table \ref{tab:runs}, in the set of E-labeled models  we
have modeled galaxies  with $\epsilon_{disk,\star}=0.01, 0.02, 0.035,
0.05,0.075$ and $0.1$; In the A-labeled models, we selected the four
values 1.5, 2.0, 2.5 and 3.0 for the $\alpha_{\text{disk,outflow}}$
parameter; We also performed simulations to search wether there is any
correlation between the studyed properties and the accretion of gas
$M_{\text{satel.,gas}}$ in the disc or bulge after a minor merger. As
we have a special interest in obtaining disk-type galaxies, for the
most of the models in Table \ref{tab:runs} we have settled
$M_{\text{satel.,gas}}\to$ to the disk. In the D and B-labeled models
we set $M_{\text{satel.,gas}}\to$ to the disk and bulge while
$F_{\text{mgr}}$ is settled to $0.2,0.3$ and $0.4$. 
  
To test wheter the values of the above metioned models are physically
reliable, we constructed the Tully-Fischer and Color-Magnitude
relations of the mock catalogues. This is decribed in the Appendix. 




\subsection{Searching LG-type Galaxies}
\label{sec:method:finding-lg}
Our investigation of the LG can be divided in two parts. The first is
intended to study  for the  different models in Table \ref{tab:runs},
the formation of MW  and M31-type galaxies; In the second one, we
study how peculiar are the LG candidates provided from the CLUES
simulations in terms of the similarity of their properties compared to
the observed ones. 


To study the similarity between the observed and the mock galaxies,
first, we define a galaxy as an object globally characterized through
$M_{disk,\star}$   $M_{disk,gas}$    $M_{bulge,\star}$    $V_{circ}$ a
stellar mass, bulge fraction  and a stellar-to-dark matter ratio. 

To study the similarity between the observed and the simulated galaxy
we make use of relative errors. Let an observed galaxy
$\rho_{obs}(p_{obs,1}, \dots ,p_{obs,n})$ be characterized by an
amount of $n$ observed properties $p_{obs,i}$, a simulated galaxy
$R_{sim}(r_{sim,1}, \dots,r_{sim,n})$ characterized by the same amount
of  estimated properties $r_{sim,i}$. The relative error between each
observated property and the modelled is
$\epsilon_i=|P_{obs,i}-R_{sim,i}|/|P_{obs,i}|$. Then,we would use the
addition of all the relative errors of all the properties 

\begin{equation}
 \Delta \varepsilon = \epsilon_i+\dots+\epsilon_n.\label{eq:relative_error}
\end{equation}

To study how much changes the abundance of LG-type galaxies for each
of the performed models, we accounted the amount of galaxies $N(\Delta
\varepsilon)$ similar to the MW and M31 under a ranges of calculated
total relative error  $\Delta \varepsilon$ as defined in equation
\ref{eq:relative_error}. We selected  three the lowest values of
$\Delta \varepsilon$ (0.08, 0.16 and 0.24) and studyed its variations
of $N(\Delta \varepsilon)$ as a function of the studyed parameters in
order find lights about wether there is any set values for our
selected set of parameter that $1)$ increases the abundace of disk
galaxies $2)$increases the amount of MW and M31-type of galaxies.

\subsection{Modeling the LG candidates}
\label{sec:modeling-lg}
We proceded to model semi-analyticaly the  pairs of LG candidates
available from the three WMAP5 boxes of CLUES. 

Two experiments were performed. Given the preliminar results of
sections \ref{sec:method:numericals} and \ref{sec:method:finding-lg},
we settled the space parameter of the two experiments to a WMAP5
cosmology and $M_{\text{satel.,gas}}\to$ to the disk component of the
galaxy. 

The first experiment was intended to recreate the experiment of the
A-labeled models of Table \ref{tab:runs}, so, we simulated the LG halo
candidates for different values of $\alpha_{\text{disk,outflow}}$
ranging from 1.5  to 3.0 in steps of 0.075. For each of the values of
$\alpha_{\text{disk,outflow}}$, we repeated the simulation 100 times
and calculated the medians of the properties of MW and M31; In the
second experiment, we recreate the experiement of the E-labeled
models.  We simulated the LG candidates through 20 different models of
$\epsilon_{\text{disk},\star}$, starting from 0.005 in steps of 0.005
to 0.1, repeated the simulation 100 times for each value of
$\epsilon_{\text{disk},\star}$ and calculated the medians of the
properties as well. Finally  it was also applied the same searching
criterium of equation\ref{eq:relative_error} to look for similarities
between the LG modeled pairs and the observed M31 and MW. 

\section{Results and Discusion}

  when the gas of the satellite goes to the disk of the galaxy. The
  error bars of each line correspond to the range of the data between
  the first and third quartils. \label{fig:properties-runs-compare}} 
\end{figure*}

Besides, as we stated in Section \ref{sec:method:numericals}, we
developed four experiments intended to study the changes in the
stellar-to-dark matter ratio, gas-to-total mass ratio and
bulge-to-total mass ratio of the simulated galaxies according to the
variation in the different models of $\alpha_{\text{outflow}}$,
$\epsilon_\star$, $F_{\text{mgr}}$ and  $M_{\text{satel.,gas}}\to$, as
described in  Table \ref{tab:runs}.  

In Figure \ref{fig:properties-runs-compare} are presented the results
of three of the above mentioned experiments. The three panels of the
left row show the results of the modification of the supernovae
activity through four different values of $\alpha_{\text{outflow}}$ in
the disk component of the simulated galaxies, the A-labeled models of
Table \ref{tab:runs}; The three panels of the central row correspond
to the E-labeled models,where we modeled our halo population for six
different values of $\epsilon_{\text{disk},\star}$; And, in the three
right panels are the results of the D-labeled models, where it is
modified the value of the $F_{\text{mgr}}$ parameter when
$M_{\text{satel.,gas}}\to$ is settled to the disk component.  

The panels on top of Figure \ref{fig:properties-runs-compare} show the
calculated medians of the stellar-to-dark matter ratio relations of
each of the experiments, the central panels are the medians of the
gas-to-total mass ratio as a funcion of the stellar mass and the ones
at the bottom are medians of the bulge-to-total mass ratio as a
function of the stellar mass. In the plot at the left on top, galaxies
with a total stellar mass content below $3.2\times 10^{10}M_{\odot}$
shows a decrease in the amount of the stellar content as it is
increased the rate of ejected mass by supernovae, and then, as it is
expected, the amount of gas content is increased as can be seen at the
left central plot. The morphology of the galaxies is affected as
well. Shown at the bottom left panel of Figure
\ref{fig:properties-runs-compare}, the net effect of increasing the
$\alpha_{\text{disk, outflow}}$ parameter produces a decrease of the
bulge-to-total mass ratio, so, it increases the amount of disk
galaxies. Nevertheless the four values of the $\alpha_{\text{disk,
    outflow}}$ parameter keep the the gas-to-total mass ratio
relations under good agreement with observations and the
bulge-to-total mass ratio relations behaves as it is espected, only
the values between $2.5$  and $3.0$ are the ones thatcan enclose the
stellar-to-halo mass relation. $2.5$  and $3.0$ are respectively
upper and lower limits of $\alpha_{\text{disk, outflow}}$ for the
stellar-to-halo mass relation of \cite{2010ApJ...710..903M}. 

In the top central panel of Figure \ref{fig:properties-runs-compare},
the stellar-to-halo mass relation show a trend related to the star
formation in the disk component of galaxies. As
$\epsilon_{\text{disk},\star}$  increases the faint end of the
stellar-to-halo mass relation tend to decrease while the bright end
increases. It has to be remarked that while the stellar-to-halo mass
relation changes, the calculated medians of the relation for the six
different models remain almost fixed arround the peak of the relation
at $1\times 10^{12}M_{\odot}$. In the central panel,  a low star
formation rate in galaxies with a stellar mass lower than $3.2\times
10^{10}M_{\odot}$ increase the gas-to-total mass ratio.  In the
central bottom panel we can see the increase of the
$\epsilon_{\text{disk},\star}$ clearly modifies the morphology of
galaxies. A higher  $\epsilon_{\text{disk},\star}$ increases the disk
component masses of the whole population of simulated galaxies and
then the abundace of disk galaxies is increased.  Nevertheless the
gas-to-total mass ratio relation keeps inside the observations for the
different E-labeled models when is compared to the data provided in
\cite{2003ApJS..149..289B} and \cite{2003ApJ...585L.117B}, the highest
values of $\epsilon_{\text{disk},\star}$ are the ones that provide a relation 
closer to the one of \cite{2010ApJ...710..903M}. The  three right
panels of Figure \ref{fig:properties-runs-compare} show the results of
the D-labeled models where it has been settled
$M_{\text{satel.,gas}}\to$ to the disk component and simulated for
different values of $F_{\text{mgr}}$. It was not found any correlation
between the $F_{\text{mgr}}$ parameter and the calculated properties,
not even when $M_{\text{satel.,gas}}\to$ was settled to the bulge in
the B-labeled models. 


\subsection{Abundance of M31 and MW-type galaxies}
\begin{figure*}
\includegraphics{figures/LG/LG-props-params-multi-v2.pdf} \caption{Estimated
  medians of the modeled properties for the MW and M31 as a function

%Horizontal line and dashed line are the MW and M31 observational references respectively in the gas and bulge
 %ratio relations.
\label{fig:properties-runs-LG}}
\end{figure*}

Now, we will analyse how changes the abundance of LG-type galaxies for
the group of experiments defined in Table \ref{tab:runs}. To do that,
we selected halos with a $z=0$ virial mass between  $11.5<\log_{10}
M_{\text{DM}}/M_{\odot}<12.5$; calculated $N(\Delta\varepsilon)$ in
ranges  of $\Delta\varepsilon$ for the observed properties of the MW
and M31 in Table \ref{tab:lg-observations}; and, study the
$N(\Delta\varepsilon)$ of the lowest values of $\Delta\varepsilon$ as
a function of function of $\alpha_{outflow}$, $\epsilon_{\star}$,
$F_{\text{mgr}}$ for the different models. 

% The  normalized distribution functions $P(\log_{10}\chi)$ of the $\chi$ parameter shown in Figures \ref{fig:mw-hist-pdf} and \ref{fig:m31-hist-pdf}
% of  MW and M31-like galaxies respectively, were calculated  for the semi-analitycally simulated galaxies with halo mass in $11.0<\log_{10} M_{\text{DM}}<13.0$ 
% in four of the models of Table  \ref{tab:runs} taking into account the observational estimations in Table \ref{tab:lg-observations}. 
% The calculated distribution functions for the models shown in Figures \ref{fig:mw-hist-pdf} and \ref{fig:m31-hist-pdf} and all the other models show only small
%  variations while the medians tend to be around $\log_{10} \chi=0.5$ and keep almost the same scatter.

% \end{figure}
% We are specially interested in how the variation of the values of the parameters between the models of each experiment affect the abundace of MW and  
% M31-type galaxies. So, in order to find wether there is a correlation between any of the parameters of the experiments and the calculated distributions
%  of the models,  we studyed $P(\log_{10} \chi)$ as a 

In Figure \ref{fig:lg-chi-disk-outflow} are plotted the
$N(\Delta\varepsilon)$ of the three lowest values
of$\Delta\varepsilon$ for MW and M31-type galaxies as a function of
$\alpha_{\text{outflow}}$ calculated  for the set of A-labeled models
of Table  \ref{tab:runs}, where the value of $\alpha_{\text{outflow}}$
was increased from $1.5$ in steps of $0.5$  to $3.0$.  It can be
observed that higher values of $\alpha_{\text{outflow}}$ increases the
amount of LG-type galaxies but priviledges the increase of the
abundace of MW-type galaxies more than that of M31-type galaxies.  


Nevertheless an increase of the value of $\alpha_{\text{outflow}}$
would produce a higher amount of LG-type galaxies, the overstate of
the supernovae feedback activity produces a decrease of the
stellar-to-halo mass relation for halos with $M_{\text{DM}}\le 1\times
10^{12}M_{\odot}$ as can be seen at the plot at the left on top of the
Figure \ref{fig:properties-runs-compare}. We found that  under the
space parameter configuration of the simulated A-labeled models,  the
proper values of $\alpha_{\text{outflow}}$ for modeling the supernovae
feedback through  equation \ref{eq:supernovae} can only be  between
$2.5 \lessapprox \alpha_{\text{outflow}} \lessapprox 3.0$, and, to
increase the abundance of disk galaxies and then LG-type galaxies,
should be choosen the highest values $\alpha_{\text{outflow}}$ below
$3.0$.

  $\alpha_{\text{outflow}}$. $N(\Delta\varepsilon)$ for the three
  lowest values of $\Delta\varepsilon=0.08,0.16,0.24$ as a consecuense
  of the variation of $\alpha_{\text{outflow}}$
  parameter. \label{fig:lg-chi-disk-outflow}} 
\end{figure}

We also made an analysis like the above with the $\epsilon_{\star}$
parameter for the E-labeled models. Figure
\ref{fig:lg-chi-disk-star-eff} shows the values of
$N(\Delta\varepsilon)$ for the three lowest values of
$\Delta\varepsilon$ calculated for LG-type galaxies as a function of
$\epsilon_{\star}$.  
  
Even though higher values of  $\epsilon_{\star}$ increases the
abundace of disk galaxies, the increase  of the star  formation in the
disk component of the sample of simulated galaxies does not favorate
the formation of LG-type  galaxies, on the contrary, the decrease of
the parameter favorates it. 

The performed D-labeled simulations with different values of
$F_{\text{mgr}}$; intended to see wether this parameter affects the
formation or LG-type galaxies or not,showed no correlation between
$F_{\text{mgr}}$ and $N(\Delta\varepsilon)$. As can be seen at the
right plots of Figure \ref{fig:properties-runs-compare}, the shape of
the simulated properties for our sample galaxies is not affected by
the $F_{\text{mgr}}$ parameter. Nevertheless of the previous result,
we found that the redirection of the gas of a satellite after  a minor
merger to the disk instead of the bulge does favorate the searched
situation, as it can be seen in Figure \ref{fig:lg-chi-gas-moves-to}
where we compare $N(\Delta\varepsilon)$ of models R2 and R3 calculated
for MW and M31-like galaxies.

\end{figure}

\subsection{The MW and M31 candidates}
As described in section \label{sec:modeling-lg}, to study the LG
candidates of the CLUES WMAP5 simulations we runned 20 models where we
repeated over 100 times  the estimation the properties in each of the
models and the calculated the medians of each property. In Figure
\ref{fig:properties-runs-LG} can be observed the estimated medians for
the stellar mass, gas fraction and bulge fraction as a function of the
parameters $\epsilon_{\star}$ and $\alpha_{\text{outflow}}$. It can be
observed that each pair of LG corresponding to the same simulations
have a similar behavior as the values of the parameters are changed.

\section{Appendix: Testing the results from Galacticus}
\label{sec:calibration}

To build the Tully-Fischer relation we used the maximum velocity of
the disc component of the discs galaxies
($M_{\text{Bulge}}/M_{\text{Total}}\le 0.3$).

  without dust extintion and the parameters of the models can be seen

  to the results of \citet{2007AJ....134..945P}.\label{fig:T-F-diagram}} 
\end{figure}
\begin{figure}

\caption{ Color magnitud relation. Magnitudes were calculated without
  extintion. This is the reference simulation presented in table
  \ref{tab:runs}  as R1, R2 and R3. The shaded region correspond to a
  scatter of  $2\sigma$ from the work  of
  \citet{2012MNRAS.423.1583M}.\label{fig:CM-diagram}} 
\end{figure}

We calculated the Tully-Fisher and Color-Magnitude relations for each
of the models in Table \ref{tab:runs}.  To build the Tully-Fisher
relation, we proceded selecting the maximum velocity between the
bulge and disk components of disk galaxies, and defined disks as
galaxies  with a bulge-to-total mass ratio
$M_{\text{bulge}}/M_{\text{tot}}\le 0.3$.  

In Figure \ref{fig:T-F-diagram} are shown de scatters of the maximum
velocity  between the first and thirth quartils  as a function of
magnitude in  the i-band without dust extintion of the data of the
three benchmarks R1, R2 and R3 compared to the data of the SDSS
\citep{2007AJ....134..945P}. It can be seen the resulting Tully-Fisher
relations of each of the benchmarks reproduce accurately the one of
the SDSS. In general none of the calculated Tully-Fisher relations of
any of the simulated models deviate significantly from ones shown in
\ref{fig:T-F-diagram}. We have also calculated the Color-Magnitude
diagrams without dust extintion of the three mentioned benchmarks. In
Figure \ref{fig:CM-diagram}, the scatter of the color between the
first and thirth quartils and the medians as a function of the r-band
reproduce accurately the estimated Color-Magnitude relation of the
SDSS \citep{2012MNRAS.423.1583M}. Again, in general, all the other
simulated models of the calculated medians does not deviate
significantly from the estimations of the best fit of the mean of the
SDSS and remains inside of the $3\sigma$ estimated deviation of the
Color-Magnitude relation.
