Code on developement. Designed to load  a pack of mergers t
rees and store'em in the HDF5 format required by Galacticus
 v0.0.1 (can be used also in Galacticus v0.9).

Base code: 
     	   Ansi C
Requirements:
	  HDF5 Command Line Tools 
          Above can be installed under Debian based systems
	  with  "apt-get install hdf5tools"
	  HDFView (Optional)
	  Above can be installed by "apt-get install hdfvie
	  w"

  *Edit
  Edit BuildTreePack.sh script variables PATH_LOCAL_IN 
  and FILE_OUT according your preferences.

  PATH_LOCAL_IN is the directory where the script will load
  the *.dat merger tree files

  FILE_OUT  is the output file that will contain the set of
  input merger trees

  *Run:
       ./BuildTreePack.sh

  *How
  MergerTreeCleanBad.c make identifies short merger trees,
  ignoring these to the output.
  **Run:
       ./MergerTreeCleanBad.out (char *)file_input

  MergerTreeHDF5.c code reads (complete) merger tree hist-
  ories extract  ed from a merger trees catalogue. Builds 
  the merger tree  HDF5 structure requiered by Galacticus
  Code (Benson 2009). 
  If interested in building HDF5 merger trees between diff
  erent initial and final snapshots than provided by sourc
  e merger tree, these can be setted via command line by p
  assing

  $export initLevel (int)init
  $export endLevel (int)end
  
  Where init_snap is the array counter number of the level
  or snpashot of interest, it means 
  snpashot[init] = init_snap
  snpashot[end] = end_snap.


  **Run:
        ./MergerTreeHDF5.out (char *)imput_tree \
                       (char *)output_tree (int)tree_number
  **Example:
	./BuildTreePack.sh


  *Notes:
  This code able to make the sibling node asociation only
  for the used example merger tree. Other formats of merg-
  er trees are not supported for this.

  remove environment variables using "unset" command.
